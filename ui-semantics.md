# Opening new worlds in Semantic
The world of Semantics is as the title suggests simple, intricate, and exquisite. When starting with Semantic UI it can be overwhelming. The amount of information they throw at you from the start is a little bit daunting. It's like going to a new fusion restaurant and looking at their menu. It has a whole set of items you sort of know but sort of don't know because they mix their cooking style with other ethnicity styles. This feeling of joy and confusion in the beginning ends when you start to use Semantics often. You start to notice its simplicity. (Note: I will be referring to the [Semantics UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)website.)

The simplicity of Semantics comes from its use of words to initiate the ui elements. Things like <i class="star icon"></i> creates an icon that has the shape of a star. You see these all over the internet which you might associate with rating something. There are of course many more options you can use with Semtantics
