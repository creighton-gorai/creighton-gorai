summary: First time taking a programming course to find my new life career and I very muuch enjoyed it even if the project was a very intro type of game.

# Beginner Passion
This was in my first ever Computer Science class where I had to make a game based on a few instructions. You create one object you control a few objects that were considered good to collect and a few that were considered bad to collect. You also had to check collisions for if your character you controlled intersected with the object and when it does "collide" run a sound and delete the icon from the screen. As a first time programmer this seemed pretty hard in building something like this, but as I took time to build the two iterations u see below. The first project was to do the simple stuff explained above. The second project used the same concepts but this time the items that u needed to collect were moving all over the screen while dodging the bad objects. Both were hard in perspective as a first time programmer, but as u go on you kind of learn that although the goal seems far you just keep at it over time and you will eventually achieve the final product. 

## Project 1
The first project is usually the hardest since it was an introduction course and I have never coded before. This however was handled with much time and dedication to create this pretty neat intro game project. The link below is my you tube video of the project what it does and such. I name the project Fin and Jakes Skyrim Adventure. I combined the idea of the cartoon series Adventure Time and the game Elder Scrolls: Skyrim which put Fin and Jake in map of skyrim collecting Skyrim element items without hitting the enemies/monsters.

## Project 2
The second project seems simpler looking than the first, but was a bit more challenging to make since all the collectables were moving around the map. This was also hindered by the enemies that are placed around the area. It was also made a bit challenging for you to not see the enemies if u run into them and the movement was a bit quicker when pressing the button. There was also a score to keep track of your collection of items and hitting enemies would decrease your score.

## Forward to the Future
This experience was well worth taking the class and getting an insight to what I want to do as a career choice. I'm hoping to start an indie game of my own off of Unity and hopefully publishing it to [steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) one day.
