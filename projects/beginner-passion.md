#Finding The Light
In the beginning of my college career I was just starting off at a Community College called *Windward Community College*. I was never sure of what I wanted as my career job neither seeing what kind of degree I wanted to achieve. So I earned my AA in liberal arts and I moved to University of Hawaii at Manoa. This is where I was taking Computer Engineering as my major still half and half in the mind for my major. I came across the class of ICS 111 which I very much enjoyed. This introduced me to the lowest level of game programming on the top of learning the bare basics in computer science. 

##The Passion
It was the year of 2016 where I found which major I wanted ot pursue for my life career job, Computer Science. I have always been a pretty religious type of gamer, but after being introduced to this kind of class I was excited for this field which challenged me to create a very low level type of game. I made 2 projects through the semester both being more difficult than the other. We used the language Java by way of Eclipse and the use of a external script called Ez which basically had all the default parts to make a game. This is where I made my two 2D collecting item games.

##Project 1
The first project is usually the hardest since it was an introduction course and I have never coded before. This however was handled with much time and dedication to create this pretty neat intro game project. The link below is my you tube video of the project what it does and such. I name the project Fin and Jakes Skyrim Adventure. I combined the idea of the cartoon series Adventure Time and the game Elder Scrolls: Skyrim which put Fin and Jake in map of skyrim collecting Skyrim element items without hitting the enemies/monsters.

##Project 2
The second project seems simpler looking than the first, but was a bit more challenging to make since all the collectables were moving around the map. This was also hindered by the enemies that are placed around the area. It was also made a bit challenging for you to not see the enemies if u run into them and the movement was a bit quicker when pressing the button. There was also a score to keep track of your collection of items and hitting enemies would decrease your score.
