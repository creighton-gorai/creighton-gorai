# From the Beginning
This is the very first lesson you learn in Unity. This took a while to complete, but such a simple first lesson had many steps to finish this small project. There are quiet a few more projects but this project shows the scope of what you can do. There is a split creation of games between 2D and 3D games and from Unity when creating the game it seems like making a 3D game is easier than making a 2D game. The 2D tutorials seems a bit more challenging since you create the field and objects in 3D sense and then when u play the game it is only view in one viewing angle. Roll a ball was a great introduction to what can be a life long career. The object of this project was simple. You are the ball and you get to move around collecting the cubes around the arena. Once you collect them all you win. Unless there is a glitch the ball should not fall outside the arena. This small and simple project taught many things such as point of view, object physics, collisions, C#, colors, and placement. It was a well worth small project that I enjoyed very much till I finished which took me maybe a couple of hours. This is also the link to the project on my github: [Roll a Ball 3D](https://github.com/creighton-gorai/RollABall)

# From a different perspective
Although I am putting a second project into this writing it is because it's the exact same project but in a different perspective. Above you see the 3D format which was actually quiet simpler than this version. Although youw ould think 2D is easier it was actually not. This project does the exact samething as above but it differences in the way that it is only from top tod own perspective. The pieces are about the same with some graphical improvements but this time it is basically the 3D format perspective from above. The link to that is also in my girhub being: [Roll a Ball 2D]()
