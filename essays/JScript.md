# JavaScript to the few
Starting my Computer science career in ICS 111 we(as a class) learned Java which held through 211. Then came ICS 212 which taught us C and C++ programming language. Which leads to now where I am in ICS 314 and we are learning JavaScript. Java as a language seemed straight forward with many helping one word functions that we could use to benefit the programs we were making. These functions were cited from a Java library in which we could reference from online. C programming took a big change to where we had to know every single reason to each line of code we were making. Allocating certain memory spots and keep track of saved values and variables. This also somewhat held true in C++ with the difference in C++ being that it was more lenient on one word functions being used gave leeway in making some programs. Coming to the present of JavaScript where it seems that everything I have learned in C and C++ totally goes out the window and we basically create variables and give them values and change scope without defining other variables in one word or line. It does somewhat resemble Java in my mind just without out the vast referencing library online like Java. It does seem like a vague type of language that can help work product faster with more general ides to accomplish a goal. I think that using specific languages are just based on the user and I would use different languages based on different situations, but for now I think that this language is just like any other language. This is the situation in which I use this language so I will use it and it's pretty good at doing what it does if I know how to use it correctly.

On a side note this class is taught in an atheletic software engineering type of way which makes the class more active. The use of JScript seems to help a lot since I have to type less and it will get quick results happen. ICS 314 which is the class that uses JScript definitly seems like a challenging class with a lot of important techniques and ettiquetes to learn. I am definitely looking forward to more of this programming language and the rest fo the semester in this software engineering class.
