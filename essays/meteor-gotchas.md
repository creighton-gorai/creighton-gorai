# Meteors Simple Toy Robot feel with many hidden intricacies

Imagine with in your mind a whole new world that you control, that you made, and that you inspire into life. This is a task that is either extremely easy or hard depending on if you are imaginative, perfectionist, or dedicated. This is the experience that Meteor offers. It is a language in which has many new opportunities which can be good or bad and can seem daunting at first at what and how to do things but eventually paint a picture of 1000 words or more once mastered. 

Meteor with all its intricacies seems really perplexing in the beginning. As a personal experience, I have come across a few things that seem hard to understand in Meteor at the beginning name two examples of knowing which files to reference so all files work together and small syntactical things to correctly make the program work accordingly to how you want it to work. 

The first problem can be described like building a simple toy robot you have two arms, two legs, a head, and a body. This robot can be assembled easily, but the robot won't work till all pieces have interconnected limbs to work as one in the finished product. This is the same as referencing all the correct files. You might have all he right extensions and helper functions but this website program might not work until you have fully reference the correct files to client and server side files respectively. 

The second problem are the small things with syntax. Being thrown head first in building your "simple toy robot" with no instructions is hard. You might know where to put all the pieces when you see things from the box picture finished product but you might have missed all the small pieces that make the robot work correctly. Think of it as assembling your simple robot and the robot moves in a backwards motion or moves in random directions when you control it. It is the same thing when diving head first into Meteor you know where things need to go when you first see it. Example would be deducing that there is a place for helper functions and extensions but not exactly sure how to correctly format the code to make this helper/extension to work properly without any syntax type of errors. Luckily ESLint can help you until a certain degree where the code is formatted correctly, but the problem persists with different files have variables that references each other but some variables you set are typed in differently such as Contacts in one file while Contact in another file. 

Even with all the struggle in the beginning the product then turns out to be a picture worth 1000 words. When you create your product, and finish it you glow with pride and self-elation that much people would enjoy and maybe celebrate after their work is done. This is a feeling worth achieving especially putting in a good dayâ€™s hard work to feel the end results.
