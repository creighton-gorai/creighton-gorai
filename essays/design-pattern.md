# Saving Time
Probably one of the most lifesaving things in CS could be the design patterns idea. The world we live in today has increasingly gotten to the point where people want things done quick and easy. Things like getting a simple cup of coffee, creating meals throughout the day, finish chores etc. People want time to do things they want to do and not the menial things in life we have to do (at times). So, the easier way to get around events that are menial in purpose to a person is to use items or methods other people have created and tested to make that menial task you are doing, to be completed in a shorter amount of time. This is the idea that design pattern uses for people who are in the Computer Science field. Design Patterns are like templates that other people have created to help people get an idea of what type of system they want to build without thinking of the system from complete scratch. It is a foundation in which we create to make a successful program in, what is supposed to be, the least amount of time we can.

I myself have recently used the publish-subscribe design pattern with in the project we have created in Fall semester 2017. Our group was tasked to create a forum like website which would help UH students give questions and get Answers from other people with in UH that also have accounts. This would be an ever-changing type of system by users and creators of the website. Adding new posts would create a whole new type of topic for specific threads of which other subscribers would need to see so the site needs to be update every time a change happens to the site. This is one example to the many other patterns I might have used in my CS career already. As you can see the idea of design patterns give you a footing so you can move progress forward with confidence and don't have to mysterious walk into the unknown.
