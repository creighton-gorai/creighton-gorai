# Are you a lazy or smart question asker?
Throughout your career in life you will always perpetually learn. Even when you think you know it all there will always be something you could know better or in a different way. This means that you might start asking questions on things you want to know about. This is where you have to strategically think before you move on to asking a question just anywhere. Hopefully, the first thing you do is look online for your answer. Use those impressively built search engines like [google](https://www.google.com/), or [Bing](https://www.bing.com/)
