# Chaos and Order
Throughout all of history there has been times with chaos such as war or order such as peace. With the multitude of things to understand when trying to get your code to work it is visually and organizationally better to keep order within the code you write. When writing code in ESLint with intellij you could see the difference in organization and could make sense of a lot more things when looking at the code. Just like everything else it will take time to get use to the standards ESlint provides. 
[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15913448/writing-clean-code-with-nested-promises) is a link of stack overflow that shows a person asking for suggestion of a type of coding standard when writing their code. Sometimes people will get lazy and start writing their code the way that just works without any care for those who will look at the code later. Those types of people who put on low standards usually make it harder for people later. This chaos type method of a coding style makes it hard to read and just impossible to follow as far as understanding what the code even does. Although it might take you longer to correct your code to make it look more organized it will help you and others in the long run. 

I was once told before that working with computers back in the "olden days" programmers had to write code for efficiency because there wasn't enough memory space to hold larger sets of codes. Now days we have much more memory to deal with which means we can spare enough space to make the code look better and readable to everyone looking at your code. This is what ESlint does to help greatly with when writing your JavaScript code in intellij. If you think about it if everyone starts writing close to the same coding standard scheme it will be easier to interpret someone else’s code and cut down the time for redoing someone’s laziness in their coding standards and have more time to finish things faster maybe even finish fast enough to take longer breaks.
